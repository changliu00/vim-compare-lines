1. Introduction                             *compare-lines-intro*

Compare-lines is a plug-in which allows you to select two lines and put the
differences between these lines in the search register.

The differences are then highlighted as searches and you can navigate through
them with the |n| and |N| commands.

2. Compare-lines Commands                   *compare-lines-commands*

2.1 Compare two lines                       *:CL* *:CompareLines*

Select two lines and highlight the differences between them.
The differences are put in the search register, this way the use can navigate
through the differences with the |n| and |N| normal mode commands.

The command can be used with three types of invocation:

>
    :CL
<
Will start the diff between current line (where the cursor is currently
positioned) and the line under it.

>
    :CL 42
<
Will start the diff between the current line and the line 42.

>
    :CL 42 66
<
Will start the diff between the line 42 and the line 66.

2.2 Focus on two lines                      *:FL* *:FocusLines*

Select two lines and focus on them. The focus is achieved by folding the lines
which are not select. This way only the selected lines are shown in the
buffer.

This command can be invoked in the same way as |:CompareLines|. I.e:

>
    :FL
<
>
    :FL 42
<
>
    :FL 42 66
<
2.3 Focus and compare two lines             *:FCL* *:FocusCompareLines*

Combines the commands |:FocusLines| and |:CompareLines|. The lines selected
are the only one shown in the buffer and their differences are highlighted
thanks to the search feature.

This command can be invoked in the same way as |:CompareLines|. I.e:

>
    :FCL
<
>
    :FCL 42
<
>
    :FCL 42 66
